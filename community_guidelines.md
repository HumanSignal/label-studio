# Community Guidelines

## Uphold the values of Label Studio
We are committed to upholding the values of Label Studio, and are intentional about how we interact and provide support to the members of this Slack community as well.

### Fight for the users
Our customers and community come first; we go above and beyond to solve their problems and help them succeed. 

### No cheap swag
We strive for the highest quality, we’re intentional, and we take pride in our work. We own the outcomes and finish what we start. 

### Light on our feet
We’re setting the pace for the industry. Quality comes with iteration, gathering data and feedback—we balance our quest for quality with staying agile and moving quickly.

### No spin zone
We’re transparent, authentic, and open to feedback and new ideas. We’re going to face challenges and make mistakes; it’s important to create an environment that allows for honesty and bad, so we can work the problem together. 

### Positive sum game
Individual success doesn’t scale. We’re one team with shared goals, shared responsibility and shared success. Collaboration across departments is how we will succeed.

## Be Human
This is an open source project made possible through a collaborative, communicative spirit. We're building something together — no need to be unkind while doing so. 

#### Take a moment to introduce yourself! (optional but helps the community)
- Update your Slack profile 
- Enter your full name (this community will work best if we are all real humans), but feel free to add a custom “display name.”
- Add a headline in the “what I do” box (it can be “title @ company” or anything that helps people know who they are chatting with).
- Add a profile photo
- Intro yourself in #01-introductions

## We're an async, global community — please be respectful of people's time.
While we're fortunate to have a team from around the globe, we operate in an async, global manner. 

If you post in off hours, please be patient, someone will get back to you. Spamming the channel or cross posting your question only clogs up our system further. 

## Asking for help
- Do your best to try and solve the problem first and share with us how you attempted to solve it, this allows us to more efficiently answer the question.
- Check out our [documentation](https://labelstud.io/guide/).

### Know your support channel
Asking your question in the right channel will allow us to help you more efficiently.

### Use public channels, not private groups
Slack is about communication, so use public channels whenever possible. This is good for transparency, but also keeps the community vibrant and alive. You also have an opportunity to help someone else who might find your conversation helpful or encouraging.
