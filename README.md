## What is Label Studio?

<a href="https://labelstud.io/blog/release-130.html"><img src="https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio/raw/master/docs/themes/htx/source/images/release-130/LS-Hits-v1.3.png" align="right" /></a>

Label Studio is an open source data labeling tool. It lets you label data types like audio, text, images, videos, and time series with a simple and straightforward UI and export to various model formats. It can be used to prepare raw data or improve existing training data to get more accurate ML models.

Have a custom dataset? You can customize Label Studio to fit your needs. Read an [introductory blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/introducing-label-studio-a-swiss-army-knife-of-data-labeling-140c1be92881) to learn more. 

## Try out Label Studio

Install Label Studio locally, or deploy it in a cloud instance. Also you can try [Label Studio Teams](https://app.heartex.com).

- [Install locally with Docker](#install-locally-with-docker)
- [Run with Docker Compose (Label Studio + Nginx + PostgreSQL)](#run-with-docker-compose)
- [Install locally with pip](#install-locally-with-pip)
- [Install locally with Anaconda](#install-locally-with-anaconda)
- [Install for local development](#install-for-local-development)
- [Deploy in a cloud instance](#deploy-in-a-cloud-instance)

### Install locally with Docker
Official Label Studio docker imageis is (here)[https://hub.docker.com/r/heartexlabs/label-studio] and it can be downloaded with `docker pull`. 
Run Label Studio in a Docker container and access it at `http://localhost:8080`.


```bash
docker pull heartexlabs/label-studio:latest
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -v `pwd`/mydata:/label-studio/data heartexlabs/label-studio:latest
```
You can find all the generated assets, including SQLite3 database storage `label_studio.sqlite3` and uploaded files, in the `./mydata` directory.

#### Override default Docker install
You can override the default launch command by appending the new arguments:
```bash
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -v `pwd`/mydata:/label-studio/data heartexlabs/label-studio:latest label-studio --log-level DEBUG
```

#### Build a local image with Docker
If you want to build a local image, run:
```bash
docker build -t heartexlabs/label-studio:latest .
```

### Run with Docker Compose
Docker compose script provides production-ready stack consisting of the following components:

- Label Studio
- [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) - proxy web server used to load various static data, including uploaded audio, images, etc.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - production-ready database that replaces less performant SQLite3.

To start using the app from `http://localhost` run this command:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

### Install locally with pip

```bash
# Requires >=Python3.6, <3.9
pip install label-studio

# Start the server at http://localhost:8080
label-studio
```

### Install locally with Anaconda

```bash
conda create --name label-studio python=3.8
conda activate label-studio
pip install label-studio
```

### Install for local development

You can run the latest Label Studio version locally without installing the package with pip. 

```bash
# Install all package dependencies
pip install -e .
# Run database migrations
python label_studio/manage.py migrate
# Start the server in development mode at http://localhost:8080
python label_studio/manage.py runserver
```

### Deploy in a cloud instance

You can deploy Label Studio with one click in Heroku, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform: 

[<img src="https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg" height="30px">](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio/tree/master)
[<img src="https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton" height="30px">](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fheartexlabs%2Flabel-studio%2Fmaster%2Fazuredeploy.json)
[<img src="https://deploy.cloud.run/button.svg" height="30px">](https://deploy.cloud.run)


#### Apply frontend changes

The frontend part of Label Studio app lies in the `frontend/` folder and written in React JSX. In case you've made some changes there, the following commands should be run before building / starting the instance:

```
cd label_studio/frontend/
npm ci
npx webpack
cd ../..
python label_studio/manage.py collectstatic --no-input
```

### Troubleshoot installation
If you see any errors during installation, try to rerun the installation

```bash
pip install --ignore-installed label-studio
```

#### Install dependencies on Windows 
To run Label Studio on Windows, download and install the following wheel packages from [Gohlke builds](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs) to ensure you're using the correct version of Python:
- [lxml](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#lxml)

```bash
# Upgrade pip 
pip install -U pip

# If you're running Win64 with Python 3.8, install the packages downloaded from Gohlke:
pip install lxml‑4.5.0‑cp38‑cp38‑win_amd64.whl

# Install label studio
pip install label-studio
```

## What you get from Label Studio

![Screenshot of Label Studio data manager grid view with images](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heartexlabs/label-studio/master/images/labelstudio-ui.gif)

- **Multi-user labeling** sign up and login, when you create an annotation it's tied to your account.
- **Multiple projects** to work on all your datasets in one instance.
- **Streamlined design** helps you focus on your task, not how to use the software.
- **Configurable label formats** let you customize the visual interface to meet your specific labeling needs.
- **Support for multiple data types** including images, audio, text, HTML, time-series, and video. 
- **Import from files or from cloud storage** in Amazon AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or JSON, CSV, TSV, RAR, and ZIP archives. 
- **Integration with machine learning models** so that you can visualize and compare predictions from different models and perform pre-labeling.
- **Embed it in your data pipeline** REST API makes it easy to make it a part of your pipeline

## Included templates for labeling data in Label Studio 

Label Studio includes a variety of templates to help you label your data, or you can create your own using specifically designed configuration language. The most common templates and use cases for labeling include the following cases:

## Set up machine learning models with Label Studio

Connect your favorite machine learning model using the Label Studio Machine Learning SDK. Follow these steps:

1. Start your own machine learning backend server. See [more detailed instructions](https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio-ml-backend).
2. Connect Label Studio to the server on the model page found in project settings.

This lets you:

- **Pre-label** your data using model predictions. 
- Do **online learning** and retrain your model while new annotations are being created. 
- Do **active learning** by labeling only the most complex examples in your data.

## Integrate Label Studio with your existing tools

You can use Label Studio as an independent part of your machine learning workflow or integrate the frontend or backend into your existing tools.  

* Use the [Label Studio Frontend](https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio-frontend) as a separate React library. See more in the [Frontend Library documentation](https://labelstud.io/guide/frontend.html).
