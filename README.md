Label Studio is an open-source, configurable data annotation tool. Its
purpose is to enable you to label different types of data using the
most convenient interface with the standardized output format.

## Introduction

Label Studio consists of two parts. Backend is a simple flask server
that is used to load the data and save the results. The frontend is a
[React](https://reactjs.org/) +
[MST](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-state-tree) app that is backend
agnostic and can be used separately, for example if you want to embed
labeling into your applications.

### Run Locally

In order to launch server locally, launch
```bash
cd backend
bash start.sh
```

To run it locally we include the compiled version of the frontend
part and an example implementation of the backend.

[Follow this guide for advanced usage & custom configuration](backend/README.md)

### Extend & Embed

To extend the functionality of embed the labeling inside your app, you
need to be able to compile it from the sources. 

[This guide explains how to do that](docs/Embed.md)

## Using Label Studio

### Config Language 

Editor configuration is based on XML-like tags. Internally tags are
represented by a react view and mobx-state-tree model. Each tag has a set of parameters, and you can look it up in the [documentation](/docs/Tags.md).

## Features

- Extensive UI configuration options
- Multiple datatypes supported: images, text, audios
- Hotkeys & History
- Converting to formats accepted by popular machine learning apps ([check here](/backend/converter/README.md) for supported GitHub repositories)
