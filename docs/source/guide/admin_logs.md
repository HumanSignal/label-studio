You can view user logs from the **Organization > Activity Log** page. Only users with the Administrator or Owner role can access this page.

Currently, there is no limit for how long activity logs are retained. 

Logs include user ID, IP address, a timestamp, and the type of action performed by logging the API request. You can find out more about each action being performed by clicking the API request. 

!!! note
    In some cases, clicking the API request will not return additional information. This is typically because the request includes sensitive information, such as a password. 

You can filter the logs by the following:

* User
* Project
* Request type (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE)
* Date range
* Request keyword
