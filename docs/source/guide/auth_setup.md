> Beta documentation: Label Studio Enterprise v2.0.0 is currently in Beta. As a result, this documentation might not reflect the current functionality of the product.

Set up single sign-on using SAML to manage access to Label Studio using your existing Identity Provider (IdP), or use LDAP authentication.

<div class="enterprise"><p>
SSO and LDAP authentication are only available in Label Studio Enterprise Edition. If you're using Label Studio Community Edition, see <a href="label_studio_compare.html">Label Studio Features</a> to learn more.
</p></div>

To more easily [manage access to Label Studio Enterprise](manage_users.html), you can map SAML or LDAP groups to both `roles` or `workspaces`. 

## Set up SAML SSO

The organization owner for Label Studio Enterprise can set up SSO & SAML for the instance. Label Studio Enterprise supports the following IdPs:
- Microsoft Active Directory
- Okta
- OneLogin
- others that use SAML assertions

After you set up SSO, you can no longer use native authentication to access the Label Studio UI unless you have the Owner role.

### Connect your Identity Provider to Label Studio Enterprise

Set up Label Studio Enterprise as a Service Provider (SP) with your Identity Provider (IdP) to use SAML authentication. Configure the IdP settings and set up the SAML attributes. 

1. In the Label Studio Enterprise UI, click the hamburger icon and select **Organization**.
2. Click **SSO & SAML**.
3. In the **Organization** field, specify the domain used for your organization by your SAML IdP. 
4. Open your IdP configuration options and add the following URLs from Label Studio Enterprise to your IdP:
  1. Copy the **URL for the Assertion Consumer Service (ACS)** that the IdP uses to redirect users to after a successful authentication and paste it into the appropriate location in your IdP configuration options.
  2. Copy the **login URL** used for logging in to Label Studio Enterprise and paste it into the appropriate location in your IdP configuration options.
  3. Copy the **logout URL** used to redirect users after successfully logging out of Label Studio Enterprise and paste it into the appropriate location in your IdP configuration options.
5. In your IdP, generate a metadata XML file, or a URL that specifies the metadata for the IdP. 
6. In Label Studio Enterprise, upload the metadata XML file or specify the metadata URL. 
7. In your IdP, set up or confirm setup of the following SAML attributes. Label Studio Enterprise expects specific attribute mappings for user identities.
   | Data | Required Attribute |
   | --- | --- |
   | Email address | Email |
   | First or given name | FirstName |
   | Last or family name | LastName |
   | Group name | Groups |
8. If you want users in specific groups to get access to specific workspaces in Label Studio Enterprise, map the **Workspace name** to a **Group** passed as SAML attributes in the SAML authentication response.
    1. In the **Workspaces to Groups Mapping** section, click **+ Add Mapping**.
    2. In the **Workspace** field, type a new workspace name or select a workspace from the drop-down list. Then, type a **Group** that matches a group name sent as an attribute in a SAML authentication response by your IdP. You can map multiple groups to the same workspace. 
    3. Click **+ Add Mapping** to map additional workspaces to groups. 
9. You can also map specific user groups to specific user roles in Label Studio Enterprise. 
   1. In the **Roles to Groups Mapping** section, click **+ Add Mapping**.
   2. Select a **Role** from the drop-down list of options, then type a **Group** that matches a group name sent as an attribute in a SAML authentication response by your IdP. You can map multiple groups to the same role. 
   3. Click **+ Add Mapping** to map additional roles to groups. 
10. Click **Save** to save your SAML and SSO settings. 

Test the configuration by logging in to Label Studio Enterprise with your SSO account.

## Set up LDAP authentication 

After you set up LDAP authentication, you can no longer use native authentication to log in to the Label Studio UI unless you have the Owner role. 

Set up LDAP authentication and assign LDAP users to your Label Studio Enterprise organization using environment variables in Docker. You can also map specific AD groups to specific organization roles in Label Studio Enterprise, making it easier to manage role-based access control (RBAC) in Label Studio Enterprise.

You can refer to this example environment variable file for your own LDAP setup:
```
AUTH_LDAP_ENABLED=1
AUTH_LDAP_SERVER_URI=ldaps://ldap.example.com #Use ldaps to secure the LDAP connection
AUTH_LDAP_BIND_DN=uid=user,ou=sysadmins,o=12abc345de12abc345de12ab,dc=zexample,dc=com
AUTH_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORD=zexamplepass
AUTH_LDAP_USER_DN_TEMPLATE=uid=%(user)s,ou=Users,o=12abc345de12abc345de12ab,dc=example,dc=com

# Query the authenticating user in the database, it can be [email|username]
AUTH_LDAP_USER_QUERY_FIELD=email

# Group parameters
AUTH_LDAP_GROUP_SEARCH_BASE_DN=ou=Users,o=12abc345de12abc345de12ab,dc=example,dc=com
AUTH_LDAP_GROUP_SEARCH_FILTER_STR=(objectClass=groupOfNames)
AUTH_LDAP_GROUP_SEARCH_ATTR_LIST=group1;group2;
AUTH_LDAP_GROUP_TYPE=ou

# Populate the user from the LDAP directory, values below are set by default 
AUTH_LDAP_USER_ATTR_MAP_FIRST_NAME=givenName
AUTH_LDAP_USER_ATTR_MAP_LAST_NAME=sn
AUTH_LDAP_USER_ATTR_MAP_EMAIL=mail

# Map AD groups to specific Label Studio Enterprise roles
AUTH_LDAP_ORGANIZATION_ROLE_ADMINISTRATOR=cn=admins,ou=users,o=12abc345de12abc345de12ab,dc=example,dc=com
AUTH_LDAP_ORGANIZATION_ROLE_MANAGER=cn=managers,ou=users,o=12abc345de12abc345de12ab,dc=example,dc=com
AUTH_LDAP_ORGANIZATION_ROLE_COORDINATOR=cn=coords,ou=users,o=12abc345de12abc345de12ab,dc=example,dc=com
AUTH_LDAP_ORGANIZATION_ROLE_COLLABORATOR=cn=collabs,ou=users,o=12abc345de12abc345de12ab,dc=example,dc=com
AUTH_LDAP_ORGANIZATION_ROLE_NOT_ACTIVATED=cn=not,ou=users,o=12abc345de12abc345de12ab,dc=example,dc=com
AUTH_LDAP_ORGANIZATION_ROLE_DEACTIVATED=

# Specify organization to assign it to all users on the platform 
AUTH_LDAP_ORGANIZATION_OWNER_EMAIL=heartex@heartex.net
```

If you want to search in several groups with recursive scan then you have to do as following:

```
AUTH_LDAP_USER_DN_TEMPLATE="" 
AUTH_LDAP_USER_SEARCH_BASES="ou=guests,dc=zflexsoftware,dc=com;ou=owners,dc=zflexsoftware,dc=com"
```

After setting up LDAP authentication for your on-premises Label Studio Enterprise instance, you can use the credentials `guest1` and `guest1password` to log in and test the setup.
