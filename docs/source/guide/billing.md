Find answers to common questions related to billing. 

### What happens if my plan is inactive?

If your subscription to Label Studio Teams expires or is cancelled, you can no longer perform labeling, review annotations, or add new users to your organization. You can log in and export your completed annotations. 

If you reactivate your plan within 90 days of cancellation or subscription expiration, you can resume all activity. If you don't reactivate the plan, all data is deleted after 90 days.

### What happens if I have too many active users?

You need to purchase additional seats for your Label Studio Teams subscription if you have more active users than your subscription allows. A user counts as an active user when they are assigned a role. Invited users that have not yet accepted an invitation appear as "Not activated" and do not count toward the seat limit.
