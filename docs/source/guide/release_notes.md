## Label Studio Enterprise 2.2
This section highlights the new features and enhancements in Label Studio Enterprise 2.2.

### New features and enhancements 
Label Studio Enterprise 2.2 introduces the following new features and enhancements.

- Label Studio Enterprise 2.2 introduces the System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) version 2.0 standard. System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) is a popular protocol to manage access for services and applications across an organization. Use the [SCIM guide](scim_setup.html) to set up SCIM integration to manage access to Label Studio Enterprise in your organization.


   <i>Check the following video tutorial about SCIM and Okta setup.</i>

- Starting with this release, as an annotator you can create a rotated bounding box with the "three point click" or "two point click" feature to annotate images.  

    - First point click - Starting point of the location to draw the bounding box.
    - Second point click - Define the rotation and width of the bounding box.
    - Third point click - Draw the height of the bounding box.

    <i>Figure 2: Three point click rectangle.</i>

    After you create the bounding box, you can do the following: 
    - Adjust it by moving the anchors or edges to the desired location on the canvas.
    - Determine that the orientation of the bounding box is effected.
    - See the orientation of the bounding box and determine the direction during the creation process.

- This release includes the `Last updated by` column in **Data Manager** with information of `updated_at` - `updated_by`, annotator/reviewer (the person who made the last modifications for any of the annotations in this task) at `updated_at` time.

- This release introduces the go-back functionality (`<` icon) that allows you to navigate back to the previous task through the review stream.
