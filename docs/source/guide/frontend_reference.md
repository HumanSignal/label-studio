Label Studio Frontend (LSF) includes several UI options and callbacks that you can use when implementing the frontend with a custom labeling backend, or when customizing the Label Studio interface.


## Updates to LSF in version 1.0.0

!!! warning
    LSF version 1.0.0 is not compatible with earlier versions of Label Studio.

If you use LSF with a custom backend, you must make changes to the API callbacks that you use as follows:

| Callback in 0.9.1 and earlier | Renamed callback in 1.0.0 |
| --- | --- |
| onSubmitCompletion | onSubmitAnnotation |
| onUpdateCompletion | onUpdateAnnotation |
| onDeleteCompletion | onDeleteAnnotation |

If you rely on specific formatting of Label Studio completed tasks, [Label Studio's annotation format](export.html#Raw-JSON-format-of-completed-tasks) has also been updated.

## Implement the Label Studio Frontend


```javascript
var labelStudio = new LabelStudio('editor', options);
```

The following options are recognized when initializing a Label Studio instance version 1.0.0.

## Options

### config

Default: `null`

Type data: `string`

XML-based configuration of the labeling interface. This configuration relies on the `data` field of the task.
See [Customizable Tags](/tags) for more information.

### interfaces

Default: `null`

Type data: `array`

Collection of UI elements to show. Available interfaces:

- `panel` - Enable navigaion panel for the current task with buttons: undo, redo and reset.
- `update` - Show a button to update the current task after submitting.
- `submit` - Show a button to submit or update the current annotation.
- `skip` - Show a button to skip the current task.
- `controls` - Enable panel with controls (`submit`, `update`, `skip`).
- `infobar` - A show button for information.
- `topbar` - A labeling interface that lists the top-level items in the Label Studio UI.
- `instruction` - A button for the [instructions](#description).
- `side-column` - Show a column on the left or right side of the Label Studio UI.
- `annotations:history` - A show button for annotation history.
- `annotations:tabs` - A show button for annotation tabs.
- `annotations:menu` - A show button for the annotation menu.
- `annotations:current` - A show button for the current annotation.
- `annotations:add-new` - A show button to add new annotations.
- `annotations:delete` - A show button to delete the current annotation.
- `annotations:view-all` - A show button to view all annotations.
- `predictions:tabs` - Show predictions tabs.
- `predictions:menu` - Show predictions menu.
- `auto-annotation` - Show auto annotations.
- `edit-history` - Show edit history.

### messages

Default: `null`

Type data: `object`

Messaging used for different actions

```javascript
{
  DONE: "Done!",
  NO_COMP_LEFT: "No more annotations",
  NO_NEXT_TASK: "No more data available for labeling",
  NO_ACCESS: "You don't have access to this task"
}
```

- `DONE` - Shown after the task is submitted to the server
- `NO_COMP_LEFT` - Shown if there are no more annotations
- `NO_NEXT_TASK` - No next task to load
- `NO_ACCESS` - Can't access the provided task

### description

Default: `No description`

Type data: `string`

Description of the current task.

### task

  },
  data: {
    text: "Labeling text..."
  },
  annotations: [],
  predictions: [],
}
```

#### id

Type data: `integer`

Default: `null`

#### data

#### annotations

Type data: `array`

Array of annotations. See the [annotation documentation](export.html#Raw-JSON-format-of-completed-tasks) for more information.

#### predictions

Type data: `array`

Array of predictions. Similar structure as completions or annotations. See the [annotation documentation](export.html#Raw-JSON-format-of-completed-tasks) and [guidance for importing predicted labels](predictions.html) for more information.

### user

User data

Type data: `object`

```json
{
  pk: 1,

  lastName: "Kubrick"
}
```

#### pk

## Event system
LSF has a built-in event system that allows you to listen to events and trigger custom actions. You can subscribe to or unsubscribe from event at any time after the Label Studio instance is initialized.

### Using events
#### Subscribe to an event

```javascript
const callback = () => {
  console.log('Event triggered');
};
labelStudio.on('event', callback);
```

#### Unsubscribe from an event

```javascript
const callback = () => {
  console.log('Event triggered');
};
labelStudio.off('event', callback);
```

!!! info
    To be able to unsubscribe from an event, you must pass the same callback function reference to the `off` method.

{% collapse "Callbacks (deprecated)" %}

  Callbacks can be used to execute actions based on user interaction with the interface. For example, label-studio server uses callbacks to communicate with an API. Pass them along with other options when initiating the instance.
