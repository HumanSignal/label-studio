## Account info

After you create an account in Label Studio, you can update the following:

* First name
* Last name
* Phone number
* Profile image (use an image no larger than 1200 x 1200 pixels or 1024 KB)

Because your email address is your username, you cannot update it. If you need to change your email address, you will need to create a different user with the new email address. 


## Access token

If you want to use the API, use this token to authenticate your API requests. 

Click **Renew** to generate a new token. Any existing scripts using your old token will lose their authorization and will need to be updated to include your new token. 

## Active organization

In this section, you can find information about your organization such as when it was created and the email address of the Owner (the user who initially created the Label Studio organization).
