## API reference for Label Studio 1.0.0

You can use the Label Studio API to import data for labeling, export annotations, set up machine learning with Label Studio, and sync tasks with cloud storage. 

See the [API reference documentation](/api) for further guidance and interactive examples. 

### Authenticate to the API

You must retrieve your access token so that you can authenticate to the API.

1. In the Label Studio UI, click the user icon in the upper right.
2. Click **Account & Settings**.
3. Copy the access token. 

In your first API call, specify the access token in the headers: 
```bash
curl -X <method> <Label Studio URL>/api/<endpoint> -H 'Authorization: Token <token>'
```

You can also retrieve the access token using the command line. 
1. From the command line, run the following: 
```bash
label-studio user --username <username>
```
2. In the output returned in your terminal, the token for the user is listed as part of the user info.  

See [API documentation for authentication](/api#section/Authentication).

### List all projects

To perform most tasks with the Label Studio API, you must specify the project ID, sometimes referred to as the `pk`. If you don't know what your project ID is, you might want to get a list of all projects in Label Studio that you can access. See the [List your projects API endpoint documentation](/api#operation/api_projects_list).

### Create and set up a project

Create a project and set up the labeling interface in Label Studio using the API. See the [Create new project API endpoint documentation](/api#operation/api_projects_create).

If you want to make sure the configuration for your labeling interface is valid before submitting it using the API, you can use the [validate label config](/api#operation/api_projects_validate_create) API endpoint.

### Import tasks using the API

To import tasks using the API, make sure you know the project ID that you want to add tasks to. See additional examples and parameter descriptions in the [import data endpoint documentation](/api#operation/api_projects_import_create)

### Retrieve tasks
Retrieve a paginated list of tasks for a specific project. If you want, you can also retrieve tasks and annotations using this API endpoint, as an alternative to exporting annotations. See details and parameters in the [list project tasks endpoint documentation](/api#operation/api_projects_tasks_list).

### Export annotations

To export annotations, first see [which formats are available to export for your project](/api#operation/api_projects_export_formats_read). 

Choose your selected format from the response and then call the export endpoint. See the [export annotations](/api#operation/api_projects_export_read) endpoint documentation for more details.

### API endpoint reference for older Label Studio versions

These API endpoints were introduced in Label Studio version 0.8.1 and are only valid until version 0.9.1. Use the [API documentation](/api), also linked inside Label Studio, for guidance when working with version 1.0.0. 

### Set up project configuration

> These API endpoints were introduced in Label Studio version 0.8.1 and are only valid until version 0.9.1. 

`POST /api/project/config`

Save labeling config for a project using API: 
```
curl -X POST -H Content-Type:application/json http://localhost:8080/api/project/config \
--data "{\"label_config\": \"<View>[...]</View>\"}"
```

Or by reading from a local config.xml file:

```
curl -X POST -H Content-Type:application/xml http://localhost:8080/api/project/config \
--data @config.xml
```

The backend returns status 201 if the config is valid and saved. 
If errors occur, the backend returns status 400 and the response body is a JSON dict like the following: 
```
{
  "label_config": ["error 1 description", " error 2 description", ...]
}
```

### Import data, files and tasks 

> These API endpoints were introduced in Label Studio version 0.8.1 and are only valid until version 0.9.1. 

`POST /api/project/import`

Use the API to import tasks in [Label Studio basic format](tasks.html#Basic-format), which can be useful when you are creating a data stream.

```bash
curl -X POST -H Content-Type:application/json http://localhost:8080/api/project/import \
--data "[{\"my_key\": \"my_value_1\"}, {\"my_key\": \"my_value_2\"}]"
```

Or you can import a file and make a Label Studio task automatically:

```bash
curl -X POST -F "FileUpload=@test.jpg" http://localhost:8080/api/project/import
```

### Retrieve project

> These API endpoints were introduced in Label Studio version 0.8.1 and are only valid until version 0.9.1. 

`GET /api/project`

You can retrieve project settings, including the total task count, using the API in JSON format: 

```json
curl http://localhost:8080/api/project/
```

Response example: 

```json
{
  ... 
  "task_count": 3,
  ...
}
```

### Retrieve tasks

> These API endpoints were introduced in Label Studio version 0.8.1 and are only valid until version 0.9.1. 

`GET /api/tasks`

To get tasks with pagination in JSON format:

```
curl http://localhost:8080/api/tasks?page=1&page_size=10&order=-completed_at
```

Response example:
 
```json
[
  {
    "completed_at": "2020-05-29 03:31:15", 
    "completions": [
      {
        "created_at": 1590712275, 
        "id": 10001, 
        "lead_time": 4.0, 
        "result": [ ... ]
      }
    ], 
    "data": {
      "image": "s3://htx-dev/dataset/training_set/dogs/dog.102.jpg"
    }, 
    "id": 2, 
    "predictions": []
  }
]
```

`order` can be either one of `id`, `-id`, `completed_at`, `-completed_at`

### Export annotations

> These API endpoints were introduced in Label Studio version 0.8.1 and are only valid until version 0.9.1. 

`GET /api/project/export`

You can use the API to request a file with all annotations, for example:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/project/export?format=JSON > exported_results.json
```

The format descriptions are presented [in the export documentation](export.html). 
The `format` parameters can be found on the Export page in the dropdown (`JSON`, `JSON_MIN`, `COCO`, `VOC`, etc).


### Health check for Label Studio

Label Studio has a special endpoint to run health checks: 
  
```bash
GET /api/health
```
