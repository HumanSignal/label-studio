---

After you install Label Studio, start the server to start using it. 

```bash
label-studio start
```

By default, Label Studio starts with an SQLite database to store labeling tasks and annotations. You can specify different sources and target storage for labeling tasks and annotations using Label Studio UI or the API. See [Database storage](storedata.html) for more.


## Command line arguments for starting Label Studio

You can specify a machine learning backend and other options using the command line interface. Run `label-studio --help` to see all available options, or refer to the following tables.

### Set environment variables
How you set environment variables depends on the operating system and the environment in which you deploy Label Studio. 

In *nix operating systems, you can set environment variables from the command line or with an environment setup file. For example:
```bash
export LABEL_STUDIO_LOCAL_FILES_SERVING_ENABLED=true
```

!!! note
    If you are using docker, you can write all your [environment variables into the `.env`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/env-file/) file.
    
    
    
On Windows, you can use the following syntax:
```bash
set LABEL_STUDIO_LOCAL_FILES_SERVING_ENABLED=true
```

To check if you set an environment variable successfully, run the following on *nix operating systems:
```bash
echo $LABEL_STUDIO_LOCAL_FILES_SERVING_ENABLED
```

Or the following on Windows operating systems:
```bash
echo %LABEL_STUDIO_LOCAL_FILES_SERVING_ENABLED%
```

## Run Label Studio on localhost with a different port

By default, Label Studio runs on port 8080. If that port is already in use or if you want to specify a different port, start Label Studio with the following command:
```bash
label-studio start --port <port>
```

For example, start Label Studio on port 9001:
```bash
label-studio start --port 9001
```

Or, set the following environment variable:
```
LABEL_STUDIO_PORT = 9001
```

## Run Label Studio on Docker with a different port

To run Label Studio on Docker with a port other than the default of 8080, use the port argument when starting Label Studio on Docker. For example, to start Label Studio in a Docker container accessible with port 9001, run the following: 
```bash
docker run -it -p 9001:8080 -v $(pwd)/mydata:/label-studio/data heartexlabs/label-studio:latest label-studio
```

!!! attention "important"
    As this is a non-root container, the mounted files and directories must have the proper permissions for the `UID 1001`.

Or, if you're using Docker Compose, update the `docker-compose.yml` file that you're using to expose a different port for the NGINX server used to proxy the connection to Label Studio. For example, this portion of the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file exposes port 9001 instead of port 80 for proxying Label Studio:
```
...
nginx:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - 9001:80
    depends_on:
      - app
...
```

## Run Label Studio on Docker with a host and sub-path

To run Label Studio on Docker with a host and sub-path, just pass `LABEL_STUDIO_HOST` env variable with sub-path to docker/docker-compose:
```
LABEL_STUDIO_HOST=http://localhost:8080/foo docker-compose up -d
```

## Expose a local Label Studio instance outside using ngrok

Sometimes it's useful to have the LabelStudio instance you're running on your local machine to be reachable over the internet.

One way to do that is to use [ngrok](https://ngrok.io/), a reverse proxy that allows you to expose your instance to the Internet.

1. Install `ngrok`: [Follow the official ngrok guidelines](https://ngrok.com/download)
2. Authenticate the `ngrok` if this is your first time running it (the token can be obtained from [Ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup)): `ngrok config add-authtoken <Your token>`
3. Start `ngrok` and point it at Label Studio: `ngrok http --host-header=rewrite 8080`
4. Copy the `Forwarding` URL `ngrok` displays. e.g.: `https://xx-xx-xx-xx.eu.ngrok.io`
5. Pass this url to Label Studio upon startup: 

```bash
# python instance
LABEL_STUDIO_HOST=https://xx-xx-xx-xx.eu.ngrok.io label-studio start
```

```bash
# docker container
docker run -it -e LABEL_STUDIO_HOST=https://xx-xx-xx-xx.eu.ngrok.io -p 8080:8080 -v <yourvolume>:/label-studio/data heartexlabs/label-studio:latest
```

!!! attention "important"
    As this is a non-root container, the mounted files and directories must have the proper permissions for the `UID 1001`.

```bash
# docker-compose
LABEL_STUDIO_HOST=https://xx-xx-xx-xx.eu.ngrok.io docker-compose up -d
```

6. Open the ngrok URL in browser to make sure you see your instance
7. Done


## Run Label Studio on Docker and use Local Storage

To run Label Studio on Docker and reference persistent local storage directories, mount those directories as volumes when you start Label Studio and specify any environment variables you need.

The following command starts a Docker container with the latest image of Label Studio with port 8080 and an environment variable that allows Label Studio to access local files. In this example, a local directory `./myfiles` is mounted to the `/label-studio/files` location. 
```bash
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -v $(pwd)/mydata:/label-studio/data \
--env LABEL_STUDIO_LOCAL_FILES_SERVING_ENABLED=true \ 
--env LABEL_STUDIO_LOCAL_FILES_DOCUMENT_ROOT=/label-studio/files \ 
-v $(pwd)/myfiles:/label-studio/files \
heartexlabs/label-studio:latest label-studio
```

!!! attention "important"
    As this is a non-root container, the mounted files and directories must have the proper permissions for the `UID 1001`.

By specifying the environment variable `LABEL_STUDIO_LOCAL_FILES_DOCUMENT_ROOT=/label-studio/files`, Label Studio only scans this directory for local files. It's highly recommended to explicitly specify a `LABEL_STUDIO_LOCAL_FILES_DOCUMENT_ROOT` path to secure the volume access from the Docker container to your local machine.

Place files in the specified source directory (`./myfiles` in this example) and reference that directory when you set up [local storage](storage.html#Local_storage). For more information about using volume mounts in Docker, see the [Docker documentation on volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/).  

If you're using Docker Compose, specify the volumes in the Docker Compose YAML file and add the relevant environment variables to the app container. For more about specifying volumes in Docker Compose, see the volumes section of the [Docker Compose file documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#volumes).


## Run Label Studio with HTTPS

To run Label Studio with HTTPS and access the web server using HTTPS in the browser, use NGINX or another web server to run HTTPS for Label Studio.  


## Run Label Studio on the cloud using Heroku
To run Label Studio on the cloud using Heroku, specify an environment variable so that Label Studio loads. 

```
LABEL_STUDIO_HOST
```

If you want, you can specify a different hostname for Label Studio, but you don't need to.

To run Label Studio with Heroku and use PostgreSQL as the [database storage](storedata.html), specify the PostgreSQL environment variables required as part of the Heroku environment variable `DATABASE_URL`. For example, to specify a PostgreSQL database hosted on Amazon:
```
DATABASE_URL = postgres://username:password@hostname.compute.amazonaws.com:5432/dbname
```
Then you can specify the required environment variables for a PostgreSQL connection as config variables. See [Database storage](storedata.html).

Our Heroku manifest uses [postgresql addon](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/heroku-postgresql) out of the box.
Please notice that the storage capacity is limited.

[<img src="https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg" height="30px">](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio/tree/master)

Please notice that all uploaded data via import will be lost after a dyno replace since [filesystem is ephemeral](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dynos#ephemeral-filesystem).
Using S3 storage is recommended.

## Run Label Studio with an external domain name

If you want multiple people to collaborate on a project, you might want to run Label Studio with an external domain name. 

To do that, use the `host` parameter when you start Label Studio. These parameters ensure that the correct URLs are created when importing resource files (images, audio, etc) and generating labeling tasks.   

There are several possible ways to run Label Studio with an external domain name.
 
- Replace the `host` parameter in the file which you specified with `--config` option. If you don't use `--config` then edit `label_studio/utils/schema/default_config.json` in the Label Studio package directory.
- Specify the parameters when you start Label Studio: `label-studio start --host http://your.domain.com/ls-root`.
- Specify the parameters as environment variables `HOST` especially when setting up Docker: `HOST=https://your.domain.com:7777`. 

Or, you can use environment variables:
```
LABEL_STUDIO_HOST = https://subdomain.example.com:7777
```

You must specify the protocol for the domain name: `http://` or `https://`

If your external host has a port, specify the port as part of the host name. 


## Set up task sampling for your project 

When you start Label Studio, you can control the order in which tasks are exposed to annotators for a specific project.  

For example, to create a project with sequential task ordering for annotators:
```bash
label-studio start <project_name> --sampling sequential
```

The following table lists the available sampling options: 

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- | 
| sequential | Default. Tasks are shown to annotators in ascending order by the `id` field. |
| uniform | Tasks are sampled with equal probabilities. |
| prediction-score-min | Tasks with the minimum average prediction score are shown to annotators. To use this option, you must also include predictions data in the task data that you import into Label Studio. |

You can also use the API to set up sampling for a specific project. Send a PATCH request to the `/api/projects/<project_id>` endpoint to set sampling for the specified project. See the [API reference for projects](/api#operation/projects_partial_update). 

Individual annotators can also control the order in which they label tasks by adjusting the filtering and ordering of labeling tasks in the Label Studio UI. See [Set up your labeling project](setup.html).
