Install Label Studio on premises or in the cloud. Choose the install method that works best for your environment:
- [Install with pip](#Install-with-pip)
- [Install with Docker](#Install-with-Docker)
- [Install from source](#Install-from-source)
- [Install with Anaconda](#Install-with-Anaconda)
- [Install for local development](#Install-for-local-development)
- [Upgrade Label Studio](#Upgrade-Label-Studio)


## System requirements
You can install Label Studio on a Linux, Windows, or MacOSX machine running Python 3.6 or later. 

### Install prerequisite
Install Label Studio in a clean Python environment. We highly recommend using a virtual environment (venv or conda) to reduce the likelihood of package conflicts or missing packages. 

### Port requirements
Label Studio expects port 8080 to be open by default. To use a different port, specify it when starting Label Studio. See [Start Label Studio](start.html). 

### Disk space requirements
Allocate disk space according to the amount of data you plan to label. As a benchmark, 1 million labeling tasks take up approximately 2.3GB on disk when using the SQLite database. For more on using Label Studio at scale and labeling performance, see [Start Label Studio](start.html). 

### Web browser support
Label Studio is tested with the latest version of Google Chrome and is expected to work in the latest versions of:
- Google Chrome
- Apple Safari
- Mozilla Firefox

If using other web browsers, or older versions of supported web browsers, unexpected behavior could occur. 


## Install with pip

To install Label Studio using pip, you need Python>=3.6 and run:
```bash
pip install label-studio
```

Then, start Label Studio:

```bash
label-studio
```
The default web browser opens automatically at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) with Label Studio.


## Install with Docker

Label Studio is also available as a Docker container. Make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed on your machine.


### Install with Docker on *nix
To install and start Label Studio at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080), storing all labeling data in `./my_project` directory, run the following:
```bash
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -v `pwd`/mydata:/label-studio/data heartexlabs/label-studio:latest
```

### Install with Docker on Windows
Or for Windows, you have to modify the volumes paths set by `-v` option.

#### Override the default Docker install
You can override the default Docker install by appending new arguments: 
```bash
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -v `pwd`/mydata:/label-studio/data heartexlabs/label-studio:latest label-studio --log-level DEBUG
```

### Build a local image with Docker
If you want to build a local image, run:
```bash
docker build -t heartexlabs/label-studio:latest .
```

### Run with Docker Compose
Use Docker Compose to serve Label Studio at `http://localhost:8080`.

Start Label Studio:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This starts Label Studio with a PostgreSQL database backend. You can also use a PostgreSQL database without Docker Compose. See [Set up database storage](storedata.html).

## Install from source

If you want to use nightly builds or extend the functionality, consider downloading the source code using Git and running Label Studio locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio.git
cd label-studio
python setup.py develop
```

Then, start Label Studio:

```bash
label-studio 
```
The default web browser opens automatically at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).


## Install with Anaconda

```bash
conda create --name label-studio python=3.8
conda activate label-studio
pip install label-studio
```

## Troubleshoot installation

You might see errors when installing Label Studio. Follow these steps to resolve them.

### Run the latest version of Label Studio
Many bugs might be fixed in patch releases or maintenance releases. Make sure you're running the latest version of Label Studio by upgrading your installation before you start Label Studio. 

### Errors about missing packages

If you see errors about missing packages, install those packages and try to install Label Studio again. Make sure that you run Label Studio in a clean Python environment, such as a virtual environment.

For Windows users the default installation might fail to build the `lxml` package. Consider manually installing it from [the unofficial Windows binaries](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#lxml). If you are running Windows 64-bit with Python 3.8 or later, run `pip install lxml‑4.5.0‑cp38‑cp38‑win_amd64.whl` to install it. 


### Errors from Label Studio 

If you see any other errors during installation, try to rerun the installation.

```bash
pip install --ignore-installed label-studio
```


## Upgrade Label Studio
To upgrade to the latest version of Label Studio, reinstall or upgrade using pip. 


```bash
pip install --upgrade label-studio
```

Migration scripts run when you upgrade to version 1.0.0 from version 0.9.1 or earlier. 

To make sure an existing project gets migrated, when you [start Label Studio](start.html), run the following command:

```bash
label-studio start path/to/old/project 
```

The most important change to be aware of is changes to rename "completions" to "annotations". See the [updated JSON format for completed tasks](export.html#Raw_JSON_format_of_completed_tasks). 

If you customized the Label Studio Frontend, see the [Frontend reference guide](frontend_reference.html) for required updates to maintain compatibility with version 1.0.0.

## Database storage
Label Studio uses a database to store project data and configuration information. 

### SQLite database

Label Studio uses SQLite by default. Label Studio expects version 3.35.x or later of SQLite, so if you have another version installed, you might see unexpected behavior. 

Label Studio stores all data in a single file in the default application data directory. After you [start Label Studio](start.html), the directory used is printed in the terminal. You can use the environment variable `LABEL_STUDIO_BASE_DATA_DIR` to specify a different directory. 

### PostgreSQL database

You can also store your tasks and completions in a [PostgreSQL database](https://www.postgresql.org/) instead of the default SQLite database. This is recommended if you intend to frequently import new labeling tasks, or plan to label hundreds of thousands of tasks or more across projects. 

When you start Label Studio using Docker Compose, you start it using a PostgreSQL database:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Create connection on startup

Run the following command to launch Label Studio, configure the connection to your PostgreSQL database, scan for existing tasks, and load them into the app for labeling for a specific project.

```bash
label-studio start my_project --init -db postgresql 
```

You must set the following environment variables to connect Label Studio to PostgreSQL:

```
DJANGO_DB=default
POSTGRE_NAME=postgres
POSTGRE_USER=postgres
POSTGRE_PASSWORD=
POSTGRE_PORT=5432
POSTGRE_HOST=db
```
