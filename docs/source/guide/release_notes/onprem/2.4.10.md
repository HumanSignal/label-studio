## Label Studio Enterprise 2.4.10

<div class="onprem-highlight">Contextual scrolling for audio and video, search field on the Projects page, autocomplete prompt when editing the labeling configuration</div>

*Sep 13, 2023*


### New features

- Contextual scrolling allows you to sync your text transcripts with their corresponding audio or video. When enabled, the text transcript automatically scrolls to the new listening point as the media plays. This is now the default mode for the Conversation Analysis template.
    
    For more information, see the [Contextual Scrolling template documentation](https://docs.humansignal.com/templates/contextual_scrolling).

- There is a new search field on the Projects page. You can use this field to search project titles. It can also be used with the project filters. For more information, see [Search projects](https://docs.humansignal.com/guide/manage_projects#Search-projects).

- When working with the labeling configuration code editor, you will now see an autocomplete prompt that lists and defines possible tags and parameters.

- You can now use the API to filter [projects by title](https://app.heartex.com/docs/api/#tag/Projects/operation/api_projects_list). 
- There is a new **Drafts** column available in the Data Manager. You can also filter and sort by this column.

### Enhancements

- When using an LLM-based ML backend, the `<TextArea>` tag now supports chat mode. You can send a prompt and receive a response to populate your TextArea inputs. 
- New tooltips throughout the UI provide guidance on advanced features and configurations to improve labeling efficiency and quality. 
- Label distribution now shows the number of labels instead of the percentage. 
- Deactivated user pages now include contact information. 
- For organizations using SSO, you can now disable regular logins for your users. 
- The project migration script has been improved to ensure that annotation history, annotation reviews, and drafts are migrated appropriately. 
- You should see improved performance in multiple API calls due to optimization work related to data handling and loading.  
- Improved exact frames matching, including adjusting BBox impact weight and improved basic matching for more accurate consensus scores. 
- Several design improvements to project dashboards:
    - Progress bars are now clearer. 
    - Task Pending Review and Annotated Tasks indicators now have labels for better clarity. 

### Security

This release addresses a vulnerability regarding how SECRET_KEY is set.

- The SECRET_KEY is now configurable through an environment variable. **Users are strongly encouraged to set SECRET_KEY to a random secret of their choosing.** A fallback SECRET_KEY is specified by default, but will be removed in a future version.
- Older versions also included a vulnerability in which the secret key could be leaked via identity provider callbacks. This release patches that vulnerability.
- **Helm Chart update**: Version 1.2.0 is now available. This version includes automatic generation of a random SECRET_KEY, which also populates a Kubernetes secret. No manual setting required. [See the full changelog here](https://github.com/HumanSignal/charts/blob/master/heartex/label-studio/CHANGELOG.md).
