## Label Studio Enterprise 2.8.0

<div class="onprem-highlight">Improved member list filtering from the Organization page, collapsible Ranker items, various UI improvements</div>

*Dec 19, 2023*

**[Helm chart](https://github.com/HumanSignal/charts/tree/master/heartex/label-studio) version:** 1.3.2

### Enhancements

- The members list on the Organization page now allows you to filter by one or more roles. By default, Deactivated and Not Activated users are hidden. This makes it easier to locate users within the member list.

- You can now expand and collapse Ranker items for easier management and rearrangement.

- Added a new `disable_reviewer_annotator_tokens`setting for organization licenses. When set to `true`, token authorization is disabled for users in the Reviewer and Annotator role. This will help maintain organization security by preventing users from accessing Label Studio via the API.

- Updated the font and spacing for the **Submit and Exit** button to match Label Studio UI styling guidelines.

- Updated text on the SAML and SCIM settings pages to match Label Studio UI styling guidelines.

- Improved error message clarity when configuring SCIM.

- Added the ability to reinstate deleted users by re-inviting them to the organization.

- Improved usability of the Label Interface Settings options, so that clicking anywhere within the description toggles the setting.

### Security

- Upgraded urllib3 to 1.26.18 to address [CVE-2023-45803](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-g4mx-q9vg-27p4), and Django to 3.2.23 to address [CVE-2023-46695](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qmf9-6jqf-j8fq).

- Patched an ORM leak vulnerability. 

- Due to an XSS vulnerability, we previously added a requirement that users must log in to view the Label Studio API doc reference and Swagger. You can now view the [API docs](https://app.heartex.com/docs/api/) without logging in. However, the Swagger version is still only available to logged in users.
