## Label Studio Enterprise 2.17.0

<div class="onprem-highlight">New reviewer workflow options, streamlined layout for the Projects page, and other UI improvements </div>

*Oct 22, 2024*

Helm Chart version: 1.6.3

### New features

#### Allow Reviewers to either requeue or reject annotations

There is a new option on the **Review** page of the project settings: **Allow reviewer to choose: Requeue or Remove**.

When enabled, reviewers will see two reject options for an annotation: **Reject** (reject and remove the annotation from the queue) and **Requeue** (reject and then requeue the annotation).

This is useful for situations in which some annotations are incorrect or incomplete, but are acceptable with some fixes. In those cases, it may be more useful to send the task back to the annotator. In other cases, where the annotation is far from correct, it is better to remove it entirely. 

For more information, see [Project settings - Review](project_settings_lse#Review).

### Enhancements

- The Projects page header has been updated with a more compact design:
    - The search bar, projects drop-down menu, and create actions have all been consolidated onto one line.
    - The **Use Template** action has been moved and is now available as a drop-down option within the **Create Project** button.
    - For better clarity, the **Use Template** action has been renamed **Create from saved template**.

- For better clarity, the Sandbox workspace has been renamed **Personal Sandbox**.
- You will now see a progress bar when performing searches against the activity log to indicate that the search is still processing.
- When creating regions that have start and end times (such as when annotating sections of an audio track), you will now see the duration of your selection under the **Info** tab.
