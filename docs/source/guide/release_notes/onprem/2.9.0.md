## Label Studio Enterprise 2.9.0
### Enhancements

- Improved webhook performance by assigning them to their own queue.

- Adjusted spacing in the SCIM and SAML/SSO pages to improve readability.

- When configuring SCIM with Okta, we will respond to their userName filter requests with the email attribute to ensure unique identifiers while maintaining compatibility.

- When hovering over the **Submitted Annotations** card on the project dashboard, the tooltip will make it clear when the number includes skipped and empty annotations.


### Security

- Fixed an issue with HTML sanitization to address a vulnerability identified by CodeQL.



### Bug Fixes

- Fixed some usability issues in the project Dashboards page related to the date picker and page refresh.

- Fixed an issue where, when labeling tasks, hiding a region would create a draft and display the **Fix and Accept** action, even if no other changes had been made.

- Fixed an issue where credential validation was failing in the Label Studio interface for cloud storages configured using SDK.
