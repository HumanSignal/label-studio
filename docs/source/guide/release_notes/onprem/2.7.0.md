## Label Studio Enterprise 2.7.0

*Nov 21, 2023*

### New Features

#### External taxonomy

This release introduces the ability to load an external taxonomy into your labeling configuration. The mechanism for this is a new `apiUrl` parameter on the Taxonomy tag, which allows you to load your taxonomy from an external JSON-formatted file. Previously, you had to use `Choice` tags to manually define your taxonomy within the labeling configuration. 

This feature provides multiple benefits, including:

- **Performance** - Significant performance improvements for large taxonomies.
- **Usability and standardization** - With JSON formatting and the ability to manage taxonomies in your editor of choice, external taxonomies are easier to organize and update.
- **Security** - You can now securely store taxonomies outside of Label Studio.

Fore more information, see [Quickly Load and Manage Large-Scale Taxonomies From External Sources](https://humansignal.com/blog/new-quickly-load-and-manage-large-scale-taxonomies-from-external-sources/), the [Taxonomy template](https://docs.humansignal.com/templates/taxonomy), and [Taxonomy tag](https://docs.humansignal.com/tags/taxonomy).

#### Group visibility in label distribution charts and drag-and-drop reordering

When a labeling configuration includes multiple label groups, you can now use the project dashboard to gain insight into label group performance.   

A new **Summary** view displays a donut chart showing label group distribution. This allows for more visibility into your labeling progress, and will help you identify areas within a project that might need additional task data.

You will also now be able to drag-and-drop the KPIs and charts to reorder them to your preference.

#### Soft delete users

Administrators can now delete users through the app or the API. This feature is intended to provide enhanced user management for administrators while minimizing potential security risks. 

Previously, administrators could only remove users by deactivating their account. However, this made it difficult to differentiate between users who are unlikely to return (such as a former employee) and users who might be temporarily inactive (such as freelance annotators). Now you can choose to either deactivate or delete a user.
