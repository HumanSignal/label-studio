## Label Studio Enterprise 2.4.9-2

*July 26, 2023*

### New features
- Workspaces now have a drop down option to allow you to edit, delete, and archive them. This enables you to hide workspaces from view while still allowing access to those workspaces as-needed
- Per-image classifications are now available.
