## Label Studio Enterprise 2.4.9-2

<div class="onprem-highlight">New workspace actions, per-image classifications</div>

*July 26, 2023*

### New features
- Workspaces now have a drop down option to allow you to edit, delete, and archive them. This enables you to hide workspaces from view while still allowing access to those workspaces as-needed
- Per-image classifications are now available. You can use the perItem parameter of classification control tags in Multi-Image Segmentation cases to attach classification to separate images in the set. For now it is supported by `DateTime`, `Number`, `Choices`, `Taxonomy`, `Rating` and `Textarea`
