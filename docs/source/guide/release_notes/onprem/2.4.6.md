## Label Studio Enterprise 2.4.6

<div class="onprem-highlight">Data Manager actions for reviewers, better placement for annotation instructions, allow email lists when inviting users</div>

*Apr 27, 2023*

### Enhancements
- Show DM actions to reviewers (works only with feature flag, contact your customer success manager to have it enabled)
- Annotation instructions are a modal instead of a top bar
- Allow to use list of emails in Members Invitation dialog
- AnnotationHistory should be removable via API

### Bug fixes
- No review object in review webhook payload
- Properly handle missing keywords: reviewed
- Hidden video regions do not move when adding new visible regions above
- Scroll to image regions if needed, but don’t scroll unnecessarily (UX improved)
