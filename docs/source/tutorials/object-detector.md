This [Machine Learning backend](/guide/ml.html) lets you to automatically pre-annotate your images with bounding boxes. It's powered by the amazing [OpenMMLab MMDetection library](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection), which gives you access to many existing state-of-the-art models like FasterRCNN, RetinaNet, YOLO and others. 

Follow this installation guide and then play around with them, picking the best model that suits your current dataset!

## Start using it

1. [Install the model locally](#Installation).

2. Run Label Studio, then go to the **Machine Learning** page in the project settings. Click **Add Model**, then paste the selected ML backend URL, by default `http://localhost:9090`.

3. On the **Labeling Interface** page, select the `COCO annotation` or `Bbox object detection` template. 
   Optionally, you can modify the label config with the `predicted_values` attribute. It provides a list of COCO labels separated by comma. If the object detector outputs any of these labels, they are translated to the actual label name from the `value` attribute.

    For example, if your labeling config contains the following:
    
    ```xml
    <Label value="Airplane" predicted_values="airplane"/>
    <Label value="Car" predicted_values="car,truck"/>
    ```
   For a specific task, the following occurs:
    - If the COCO object detector predicts a bbox with label `"airplane"`, you see the label `"Airplane"`.
    - If it predicts `"car"` or `"truck"`, either of those predictions are squashed to show the `"Car"` label on the task.

   For more information, see [the full list of COCO labels](#The-full-list-of-COCO-labels). 


## Installation

1. Set up the MMDetection environment following [the MMDetection installation guide](https://mmdetection.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.0/INSTALL.html). Depending on your OS, some dependencies might be missed, such as gcc-c++, mesa-libGL. Install them using your package manager.

2. Create and initialize the directory `./coco-detector`:

    ```bash
    label-studio-ml init coco-detector --from label_studio_ml/examples/mmdetection/mmdetection.py
    ```

3. Download the `config_file` and `checkpoint_file` from MMDetection model zoo (use the [recommended Faster RCNN for a quickstart](https://mmdetection.readthedocs.io/en/latest/1_exist_data_model.html#inference-with-existing-models)). Place the `config_file` within the cloned [mmdetection repo](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection).

The following sections present the different settings for how to run this ML backend based on a specific use case. 

## Run ML backend on the same machine as Label Studio

If you run the ML backend on the same machine as Label Studio, you can upload images directly to Label Studio or specify them as remote URLs. 

#### Images are uploaded in Label Studio UI
   ```bash
   label-studio-ml start coco-detector --with \
   config_file=mmdetection/configs/faster_rcnn/faster_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x_coco.py \
   checkpoint_file=/absolute/path/to/downloaded/checkpoint.pth
   ```
In this case, the ML backend reads images from the default data upload folder.
If you change the default upload folder, for example by setting `LABEL_STUDIO_BASE_DATA_DIR=/custom/data/path`, you must explicitly specify the upload folder:

   ```bash
   label-studio-ml start coco-detector --with \
   config_file=mmdetection/configs/faster_rcnn/faster_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x_coco.py \
   checkpoint_file=/absolute/path/to/downloaded/checkpoint.pth \
   image_dir=/custom/data/path/media/upload
   ```

#### Images are specified as remote URLs

   ```bash
   label-studio-ml start coco-detector --with \
   config_file=mmdetection/configs/faster_rcnn/faster_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x_coco.py \
   checkpoint_file=/absolute/path/to/downloaded/checkpoint.pth
   ```

## Run ML backend server on the different machine as Label Studio

When running the ML backend on a separate server instance and connecting it to Label Studio with a remote hostname URL, you must remember that your ML backend server must get the full image URLs.
In this case, you must provide the Label Studio hostname before running ML backend:

   ```bash
   LABEL_STUDIO_HOSTNAME=http://my.label-studio.com:8080 label-studio-ml start coco-detector --with \
   config_file=mmdetection/configs/faster_rcnn/faster_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x_coco.py \
   checkpoint_file=/absolute/path/to/downloaded/checkpoint.pth
   ```

## Other parameters

You can also specify other parameters when you start this ML backend to fit your use case or environment.
Addionaly check our [Quickstart](/guide/ml.html#Quickstart-with-an-example-ML-backend).

#### GPU support
If you have a GPU available, you can specify that with `device=gpu:0` (or `cuda:0` for newer versions of pytorch and mmdetection) when you start the ML backend to significantly speed up pre-annotation of images. For example:

 ```bash
   label-studio-ml start coco-detector --with \
   config_file=mmdetection/configs/faster_rcnn/faster_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x_coco.py \
   checkpoint_file=/absolute/path/to/downloaded/checkpoint.pth \
   device=gpu:0
   ```

#### Bounding box thresholding

You can also tune the `score_threshold`. Lower values increase sensitivity but produce more noise.

   ```bash
   label-studio-ml start coco-detector --with \
   config_file=mmdetection/configs/faster_rcnn/faster_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x_coco.py \
   checkpoint_file=/absolute/path/to/downloaded/checkpoint.pth \
   score_threshold=0.5
   ```
