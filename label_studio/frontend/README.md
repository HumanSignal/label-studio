# Label Studio

This folder holds all the pieces of the new frontend framework.

## Init and build

By default this section comes pre-built. Until you need to make any changes to the frontend part, you're good to go as is.

**To work with frontend you need NodeJS to be installed on your system.**

To build and run the frontend, please follow these steps:

```bash
# Install all the necessary modules
npm ci

# Run webpack
npx webpack
```

It's also possible to compile frontend on the fly:

```bash
npx webpack --watch
```

## Creating pages

Pages could be either Django templates or React components.

### Django

Consider Django templates as a fallback if there's no proper React component for a page.

To create a page using Django is simple and straightforward: select an app within `label_studio/` directory, add a url and create a view with a html template. React app will handle it automatically if there's no React page for a particular route.

### React

**Important notice:** you still have to add url to `urls.py` under one of the Django apps so the backend won't throw a 404. It's up to you where to add it.

All the pages live under `frontend/src/pages` and are self-hosted. It means every page defines it's route, title, breadcrumb item and content.

Pages organized as page sets: every folder under `frontend/src/pages` is a page set that can contain one or more pages.

To add a new page follow these steps:

##### Choose existing page set or create a new one

Let's say we're creating page set from scratch. To do that we need a directory: `frontend/src/pages/MyPageSet`

##### Create a component file under a page set directory

React components are simple functions, so it's enough to write:

```js
export const MyNewPage = () => <div>Page content</div>
```

This would be a legit component and a page

##### Setup title and route

This is done by adding properties to a component:

```js
MyNewPage.title = "Some title"
MyNewPage.path = "/my_page_path"
```

##### Create a page set

If you're creating a new page set there's an additional step: you need to create an `index.js` file in the root of your page set. A path would be `frontend/src/pages/MyPageSet/index.js`

This is necessary to group all the pages under the page set. Content of that file would be:

```js
export { MyNewPage } from './MyNewPage';
```

At this point you can also setup a layout wrapper around the page set. In this case content of the file will be a little bit different:

```js
import { MyNewPage } from './MyNewPage';

export const MyLayout = (props) => {
  return (
    <div className="some-extra-class">
      {props.children}
    </div>
  )
}

MyLayout.title = "My Page Set";
MyLayout.path = "/some_root"
```

Notice the `props` argument and `props.children`. This is the default React way of passing content to the component. It will work for every component you create. In this case `children` would be a content of a single page you create depending on current route.

Layout can also be extended with `title` and `path`.

Keep in mind that if you're setting `path` property on the layout, every page under this layout will become a nested route and will extend layout's path. It meast that the page we defined earlier will have a full path of `/some_root/my_page_path`.

##### Adding page set to a router

Now the last step is to add our page set to the app. This is done inside `frontend/src/pages/index.js`:

```js
// First we need to import the page set we've created
import * as MyPageSet from './MyPageSet'
/* ...other imports might be here... */

export const Pages = {
  /* other pages here */,
  // Next goes our page set
  MyPageSet,
}
```

Now we're done. We can now open the page `/some_root/my_page_path` in the browser and see everything in action.

### Page and Route component properties

* `title` – page title and a breadcrumb. can be string or function
* `routes` – nested list of routes
* `layout` – layout component to wrap around nested paths
* `pages` – set of pages
* `routes` – set of raw routes
* `exact` – if true, lookup exact path rather than a subscring
