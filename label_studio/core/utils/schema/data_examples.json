Additionally, they are known for their unique defense mechanism, called 'playing possum,' where they mimic the appearance and smell of a dead animal to deter predators."

This makes them valuable allies for gardeners and homeowners, as they help to maintain a balanced ecosystem and reduce the need for chemical pest control methods."

They have a unique protein in their blood called 'Lethal Toxin-Neutralizing Factor' (LTNF), which neutralizes venom from a variety of snake species, including rattlesnakes and cottonmouths. This allows opossums to prey on snakes without fear of harm, further highlighting their important role in the ecosystem."
