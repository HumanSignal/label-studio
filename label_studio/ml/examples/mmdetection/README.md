meta_title: Prelabel Images with Bounding Boxes Tutorial
meta_description: Label Studio tutorial for automatically pre-labeling or pre-annotating images with bounding boxes using OpenMMLab MMDetection library and Label Studio.
---

This [Machine Learning backend](https://labelstud.io/guide/ml.html) allows you to automatically prelabel your images with bounding boxes. It is powered by amazing [OpenMMLab MMDetection library](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection), which gives you access to many existing state-of-the-art models like FasterRCNN, RetinaNet, YOLO and others. 

Check this installation guide and then play around them, pick up the best model that suits your current dataset!


## Start using it

1. [Install the model locally](#Installation)

2. Run Label Studio, then go to the **Model** page. Paste the selected ML backend URL then click on **Add Backend**.

3. Go to **Setup** page, use `COCO annotation` template or `Bbox object detection`. O
   Optionally you can modify label config with `predicted_values` attribute. It provides a list of COCO labels separated by comma. If object detector outputs any of these labels, they will be translated to the actual label name from `value` attribute.

    For example:
    
    ```xml
    <Label value="Airplane" predicted_values="airplane"/>
    <Label value="Car" predicted_values="car,truck"/>
    ```
   
means that
- if COCO object detector predicts bbox with label `"airplane"`, you'll finally see the label `"Airplane"`.
- if it predicts `"car"` or `"truck"` - they will be squashed to `"Car"` label.

[Here is](#The-full-list-of-COCO-labels) the full list of COCO labels for convenience.


## Installation

1. Setup MMDetection environment following [this installation guide](https://mmdetection.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.0/INSTALL.html). Depending on your OS, some of the dependencies could be missed (gcc-c++, mesa-libGL) - install them using your package manager.

2. Create and initialize directory `./coco-detector`:

    ```bash
    label-studio-ml init coco-detector --from label_studio/ml/examples/mmdetection.py
    ```

3. Download `config_file` and `checkpoint_file` from MMDetection model zoo (use [recommended Faster RCNN for quickstarting](https://mmdetection.readthedocs.io/en/latest/1_exist_data_model.html#inference-with-existing-models)).

4. Launch ML backend server:

   ```bash
   label-studio-ml start coco-detector --with \
   config_file=/absolute/path/to/config_file \
   checkpoint_file=/absolute/path/to/checkpoint_file \
   score_threshold=0.5 \
   device=cpu
   ```

> Note: It's highly recommended to use device=gpu:0 if you have a GPU available - it will significantly speed up image prelabeling.

> Note: Feel free to tune `score_threshold` - lower values increase sensitivity but produce more noise.
