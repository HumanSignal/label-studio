# Label Studio

Label Studio is a complex, NX-managed project divided into three main components:

## [Main App (`apps/labelstudio`)][lso]
This is the primary application that consolidates all frontend framework elements. It's the hub for integrating and managing the different libraries and functionalities of Label Studio.

## [Library - Label Studio Frontend (`libs/editor`)][lsf]
Label Studio Frontend, developed with React and mobx-state-tree, is a robust frontend library tailored for data annotation. It's designed for seamless integration into your applications, providing a rich set of features for data handling and visualization. Customization and extensibility are core aspects, allowing for tailored annotation experiences.

## [Library - Datamanager (`libs/datamanager`)][dm]
Datamanager is an advanced tool specifically for data exploration within Label Studio. Key features include:

## Installation Instructions

1 - **Dependencies Installation:**
- Execute `yarn install --frozen-lockfile` to install all necessary dependencies.

2 - **Environment Configuration:**
#### Custom Configuration for DataManager:
- If you need to customize the configuration specifically for DataManager, follow these steps:
  - Duplicate the `.env.example` file located in the DataManager directory and rename the copy to `.env`.
  - Make your desired changes in this new `.env` file. The key configurations to consider are:
      - `NX_API_GATEWAY`: Set this to your API root. For example, `https://localhost:8080/api/dm`.
      - `LS_ACCESS_TOKEN`: This is the access token for Label Studio, which can be obtained from your Label Studio account page.
- This process allows you to have a customized configuration for DataManager, separate from the default settings in the .env.local files.
