## Label Studio public roadmap

We love open source and are inspired by community-driven development. 
That's why we made our Label Studio roadmap publicly available. Here is a link:

[Label Studio Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/heartexlabs/projects/1)

If you want to contribute or make a feature request for the next release, please read this guide first.

## Guide

The roadmap exposes our development plans for the next few quarters.

It's structured in columns with the following information:

**Q2 Apr-Jun**
Describes what is expected to be done in terms of:
- **Focus on** the main goals,
- **Expected release** links
- **Main deliverables** anticipated at the end of the current period.

Though the roadmap reflects most of the current data annotation community needs, and shows the general direction of Label Studio development, it's not a final "do-or-die" document. The roadmap might change due to unforeseen circumstances or other reasons.

#### Contribution

The easiest way to contribute to Label Studio is by creating a [feature request](https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio/issues/new?assignees=makseq&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=), or review the [existing ones](https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio/issues) 
and leave your comment or vote. 

GitHub issues are processed in the following steps:

1. Issue is assigned to the [Label Studio Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/heartexlabs/projects/1) project. This means we're on it and things are going to happen.
2. Issue is assigned to a milestone referring to a specific Label Studio version. This means you can get your feature in a public release by a specific date (the end of the assigned milestone), or even early in a bleeding-edge version (master branch).

We prioritize all created requests according to the current roadmap. If your feature request or submitted issue is left without any tag or assignment, no worries. Give it some time â€” we'll include it later, or you can [ping us on Slack](https://slack.labelstudio.heartex.com/?source=github-roadmap) if you think it's very urgent.
